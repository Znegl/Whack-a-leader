Whack-a-leader
==============

A game for whacking scout leaders.

Physical game setup
-------------------

A projector displays the game on a wall
Just below the projected image (or on the image) 8 copper tape strips are mounted in pairs so that the players can connect a pair by placing his hand on it.
To position the pairs correctly you should divide the screen into four vertical rectangles and place the pairs in the center of each rectangle.
The pairs are hooked up to a Makey Makey as follows:
* Pair one => up arrow & ground
* Pair two => down arrow & ground
* Pair three => left arrow & ground
* Pair four => right arrow & ground

Somewhere else another set of strips is mounted. These should be connected to space & ground.

For debugging the numbers 1 through 4 on the keyboard are also mapped to the 4 parts of the screen.

Open index.html in your favorite browser (aka Chrome) and make the browser go into full screen mode.
Connect the Makey Makey.
